# Credex Task

Welcome to the project! This application uses React with a touch of Bootstrap for styling, aimed at delivering a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features Implemented

- **Bootstrap Styling:** The project imports Bootstrap CSS to ensure a modern, responsive design that looks great on any device.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Each part of the UI is built as a reusable component, making the code more organized and easier to manage.
- **Strict Mode:** The application is wrapped in Reactâ€™s StrictMode to help identify potential issues during development.

## Design Choices

- **User Experience First:** By using Bootstrap and well-organized React components, the app aims to provide an intuitive and smooth experience.
- **Modularity:** Breaking down the UI into small, independent components not only helps in maintaining the code but also makes it easier to scale in the future.
- **Maintainability:** The use of React's best practices (like StrictMode) ensures that the code remains healthy and maintainable over time.

## Time Spent

- **Setup & Planning:** ~1 hour to plan the structure and initialize the project.
- **Development:** ~5 hours spent building the initial components and integrating Bootstrap.
- **Testing & Refinement:** ~1 hour for testing the UI and smoothing out any issues.

**Total Time:** Approximately 7 hours
